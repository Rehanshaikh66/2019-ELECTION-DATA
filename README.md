## Problem & background
The data contains election results data from India. It seems to provide constituency-level voting data for the
2019 Indian general elections. Some of the key fields included are State, Constituency, Winner, Party, Gender,
Assets, Votes etc. At a high level, the data allows analysis of voting patterns at the constituency level across
different states and parties in India. It also provides insights into the profile of winning and losing candidates
based on factors like gender, education, assets etc. Analysing this data can yield interesting findings about
electoral preferences and outcomes in the world's largest democracy.To find States/UTs and Constituency that
have highest and the lowest Voter Turnout ,Elected MPs that have criminal record and their party-wise
distribution, Distribution of assets, liabilities, and net worth of the elected MPs, 10 constituencies that saw the
Most One-sided and the Closest victories, Region-wise distribution of seats across the country . It is a big
Project Completed on the Basis of Strategic Analysis

## Solution
★ The states with the highest and lowest voter turnout were Hamirpur (H.P.) and Anantnag (J&K) with
131.28% and 8.40% voter turnout respectively. Overall, the highest turnouts were in smaller
northeastern states while the lowest were in larger states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and
Maharashtra.


★ As per the data, a total of 539 elected MPs have declared criminal cases against themselves. The
party with the most such MPs is BJP with 300, followed by INC with 52 and DMK with 23. Several
other national and regional parties also have MPs with criminal cases.


★ The data shows significant variation in assets, liabilities and net worth of elected MPs. The MP with the
highest declared assets is Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy while Piyush Goyal has the lowest. Total
assets of all MPs added up to over 1 trillion rupees while liabilities were around 194 billion rupees.


★ The 10 constituencies with the most one-sided victories based on vote share were in Himachal,
Maharashtra, Assam, and Uttarakhand ranging from 50-83% vote share. Meanwhile the closest
victories were in West Bengal with margins of 1-3% vote share between winner and runner up.

★ Among the Region analysed, theEAST INDIA stands out, offering 600 Which is the highest number of
SEAT compared to other Region.

## Methodology & Project scope
1.**Data Collection:**
The dataset contains information about 2018 Lok Sabha elections from across different states
and constituencies in India. The data has been collected from multiple sources including
Election Commission of India website, Affidavit submissions of candidates to EC , Kaggel etc .
A total of 22 columns and 2018 rows of data has been collected.


2.**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing since some columns had blank values or
missing data. The assets and liabilities columns were cleaned by subtracting liabilities from
assets to create a net worth column. New columns like state2, region were also added by
mapping state codes.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
New meaningful features like voter turnout were engineered by dividing total votes by total
electors to understand constituency wise voting patterns. The cleaned dataset was then
transformed into a more analytical format for modelling.

5. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
A descriptive statistical analysis was done to understand distribution of variables and identify
outliers. Data was aggregated and summarised using Excel Formulas , pivot Table etc to extract
meaningful insights. Various charts like bar plots, histograms were used to visualise trends.
To make our analysis easily accessible and user-friendly, we will create a dashboard. This
dashboard will serve as a centralised hub, presenting all suggested analyses in a straightforward
manner. Users will be able to gain a quick overview of the data and base their judgments on the
key findings presented in the dashboard.

6. **Deriving Insights and Business Recommendations:**
Based on above steps, various insights into constituency demographics, candidate profiles, party
performance and voting behaviours can be understood. Analysis can help political parties,
candidates in designing constituency-specific strategies or promotional campaigns based on
local sentiments.

## Concepts Used
● Count, Average, Pivot table, VLOOKUP, Max, Min, Charts, Graphs, filters, Round, Pivot
chart ,Work-Life Balance, Gender Equality etc.

## Conclusion
The goal of this project was to analyse data on Indian MPs elected in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
By consolidating the data into a single spreadsheet, we were able to get a comprehensive view of
various metrics including gender representation, criminal records, age distribution, voter turnout, and
financial status of the elected representatives.
The analysis revealed some interesting insights. Only 14% of elected MPs are women, highlighting
the need for greater gender equality in Indian politics. We also found that over 25% of MPs have
criminal cases against them.Finally, the average assets of MPs were found to be very high, at over Rs
11 crore, but so were the liabilities, resulting in a lower average net worth of around Rs 9 crore.
Overall, this analysis accomplished the intended goal of aggregating and examining data on the 2019
Lok Sabha winners. The findings can help inform efforts towards improving representation, reducing
criminalization, engaging youth, increasing voter participation, and highlighting the financial status of
elected officials. Regular analysis of such data can track progress on these fronts over time.
